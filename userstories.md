I want users to be able to submit links of their choosing for others to view.
I want users to be able to upvote and downvote links depending on their choosing.
I want users to be able to create an account and cancel their account.
I want users to be able to edit their links when they're signed in and not letting others have access.
I want users to be able to delete their links incase they don't want them up for whatever reason.
I want users to be able to see who posted the link and how many upvotes/downvotes they received to judge the link for themselves.
