## Project Workflow
Meets expectations. But only because you included user stories! It would be really nice to have some ERD's and wireframes. Additionally, readme are standard for applications that have a lot of that same content as well maybe some icebox features you'd like to implement and setup instructions.

## Technical Requirements
Meets expectations. I like your app, its nice and simple. Post link, up and down vote them. I think it'd be really cool to implement a favoriting feature in this app and shouldn't be too difficult. Also I like that you used the acts_as_votable gem, its a good one. Also some validations would be nice as well on your link model. Another good bit of practice you can get with associations is by handrolling a voting solution.

## Code Quality
Meets expectations. Code is properly indented. Although some of it was generated, looks pretty clean. There is, however, a lack of commenting throughout your code base.

## Deployment and Functionality
Meets expectations. Site is deployed. The functionality is pretty solid. The only issue is visiting the link. It just appends the href to the whole url of your site. To fix this just include `http://` in front of the url.

## Overall
Great job on this project Jared. Though I will say I had higher expectations of you. But you also did mention you pivoted several times. Interested to know what you thought about the ESPN API. I thought they had discontinued public service.

Let me know if you have any questions/comments/concerns about rubric and/or feedback.
